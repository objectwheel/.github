Objectwheel Readme May 28th, 2022 A Big day for us. about 1:59pm right now. I'm excited to share
we are opensource. This project was 4 years work by myself and Omer with help from Narayan, David
myself, (Mike Tallent). We had no choice but to opensource because of licencing issues. QT would not
talk with us although we tried very hard. We will be launching a coin on Cardano called 
Objectwheel Token. We will consider a kickstarter. Video below shows all of Omer's hard work guided by
God, and guided by me. It started out as Javafx with David in 2010 and we could not get it done. 
Reboot as cross platform QT, and here we are. More info soon. Thanks to all that have supported us
Tim, Ella, my Mom, and many others. We love you all.
